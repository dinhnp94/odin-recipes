    fudge cake with smooth icing is an instant baking win</p>
    
     <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>   
     <p>
        <ul>
            <li>150ml sunflower oil, plus extra for the tin</li>
            <li>175g self-raising flour</li>
            <li>2 tbsp cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
            <li>150g caster sugar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp golden syrup</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>150ml semi-skimmed milk</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Oil and line the base 
                of two 18cm sandwich tins. Sieve the flour, cocoa powder 
                and bicarbonate of soda into a bowl. Add the caster sugar and mix well.</li>
            <li>Make a well in the centre and add the golden syrup, eggs, 
                sunflower oil and milk. Beat well with an 
                electric whisk until smooth.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into the two tins and bake for 25-30 
                mins until risen and firm to the touch. Remove from 
                oven, leave to cool for 10 mins before turning out 
                onto a cooling rack.</li>
            <li>To make the icing, beat the unsalted butter in a bowl 
                until soft. Gradually sieve and beat in the icing sugar 
                and cocoa powder, then add enough of the milk to make 
                the icing fluffy and spreadable.</li>
            <li>Sandwich the two cakes together with the butter icing 
                and cover the sides and the top of the cake with more 
                icing.</li>
        </ol>
